# Vishnu21st Backend

## Installation

- If you're using `docker`. You can use devcontainer which will auto setup all env for you.
- If you're not. please run `npm install` or related.
- **Regulation** please use `npm` instead of yarn or pnpm. I know it's better in term of development. But please use something stable on production is better.
- If you really want to use others. please **don't push lockfile** to git. I will reject all PR if you're pushing them.

## Development

- Ask PM for development env. Place it as `.env` file.
- Make sure you did run `Prisma migration`!!
